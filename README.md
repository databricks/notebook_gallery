# Upgrades in Developing with Databricks Notebooks

This repo contains a sample Databricks Notebook with the latest developer experience updates, including:

* Variable inspection
* Code formatting
* Run selected text
* `pdb` - the interactive Python debugger
* Code folding
* Auto-complete as you type
* and more...

To try these out yourself, make sure to [enable the new notebook editor](https://docs.databricks.com/notebooks/notebook-editor.html), then you can import [the example notebook](https://github.com/databricks/notebook_gallery/blob/main/Notebook%202.0%20Feature%20Gallery.py) into your Databricks workspace and use it with any compute running DBR > 11.2.
